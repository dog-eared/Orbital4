Orbital4 is a variation on Connect4 wherein players can drop pieces in four directions onto a single point
in the middle of the screen.

=======
## HOW TO PLAY:

Players take turns dropping pieces by clicking the buttons around the main game board.

Pieces travel in a straight line from the button to the other side. They must connect to another piece to either the left, right,
above or below to be valid.

The first player to get four in a row in any direction (including diagonals) is the winner.

If you get 4 in a row in multiple directions, you get multiple points (and the other player feels even dumber). 

## THINGS I'D LIKE TO DO:
- implement a computer controlled player
- add visual display of winning combinations
- add customizable player colours
- revamp GUI
- neverending mode, where the game isn't over when someone gets 4 in a row
- pieces smoothly sliding in from off screen

**This project is complete for the time being.**
